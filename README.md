Logging the team build of the Sandcrawler Lego

Keeping with the 'Tradition' started by Chris Laco...
It's happened again.  In true RPC fashion, we are already onto the next revision of our product, shortly after the last one released.  This time, we aren't doing it in alphabetical order though.  So, don't look for some 'N' named project.  We are skipping on to 'S'.

Introducing "Star Wars Legos in the Private Cloud v2.0 - Sandcrawler"

Darrin Hanson has kindly made the offering of the next build for your time consumption enjoyment.  The same rules apply as before, so let's make it happen!
There are only 2 rules:
  1. No "Cowboy Coding". Only do a few pages. Don't complete entire sections by yourself. This is a team effort.
  2. Communicate Progress. There are a few blank log sheets. When your start, pick up where the last person finished. When you're done, log the last step you completed so the next person knows where to start.
That's it! Have fun. LEGOs!
